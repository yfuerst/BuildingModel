** About

This repository contains a complex building model in Modelica to generate
mathematical representations of real buildings. The focus lies on detailed
reproductions, rather than simplified approaches. The implementation of the
model allows a fast and less error prone parameterization, while the modeling
space is kept clean at the same time.

The model was developed as part of a research project, which focuses on the
optimization of control strategies of building energy systems. In control
theory it is quite common to test developed strategies in simulations first,
before performing tests on real systems.

** Dependencies

The building model of this library is based on the complex room model
=Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed.MixedAir= from the latest official release of
the [[https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings][Modelica Buildings library]].

** Todo

- The documentation is incomplete. Right now, it is recommended to stick to the
  examples.
